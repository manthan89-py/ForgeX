ForgeX is a chatbot trained on the SciQ dataset, a collection of scientific questions and answers available on Kaggle. It is designed to provide answers to queries related to science and technology. Additionally, ForgeX includes features for greetings, goodbyes, and other common interactions to make the chatbot more user-friendly.

## Features

- Answers queries related to science and technology.
